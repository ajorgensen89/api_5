# Testing
This file holds examples of testing methods used for creating this API.

## PEP 8 linter.

[PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) with Code Institute to check [Python](https://www.python.org) code.<br>
<br>
PEP8 Packages can be installed in the coding environment.<br>

## Extension.
Extensions added to the workspace can help improve the experience of coding by assisting with debugging, Linters, formatting and much more. <br>
Example of using an exntension.<br>

<br>
[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [Python Linting Extentions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) based extensions can be installed to help to perfect the look of a coding environment by providing linting support for [Python](https://www.python.org/) code.<br>
<br>
'Problems' tab within the coding workspace can be used to suggest problems within the code to be fixed with use of an extension.<br>
Example showing whitespace that needs to be removed and unused imports.<br>
